# Punk Donuts — Vercel Static Site

Zero-build static site. Import via Git, no build step.

## Deploy
1) In Vercel: New Project → Import Git Repository → select this repo.
2) Framework Preset: Other. Build Command: none. Output Directory: (blank).
3) After deploy: Project Settings → Domains → add subdomain.

## Waitlist Form
Replace the form in index.html with your Google Form embed iframe. I can create the Form and embed on request.

## Assets
Logo and hero images are hotlinked from storage for now. We can move assets local later if needed.
